Odin Project Basic Recipe Website

This project is a test of my current working knowledge of git and html, the object is to create a very basic website using only hmtl that hosts a food recipe.  I will refer to my notes as needed and attempt to use best practices, and can come back to the initial version of this once i have learned more to see what my work once looked like.
